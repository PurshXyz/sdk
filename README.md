## ✨ What is Pursh?

Pursh is an intelligent shopping agent designed to remove friction from discovery and purchasing.

Instead of searching, filtering, and comparing endlessly, users (or AI agents) simply **describe what they want**.  
Pursh interprets intent, explores the market, and returns the best possible matches.

Think of Pursh as:
- A search engine that *understands intent*
- A shopping assistant that never sleeps
- A commerce layer usable by both humans **and** autonomous AI
